## main.py:

Text your phone number your current Glucose Number!

Display your CGM data to your terminal using Python + Pydexcom!

A Dexcom account with a physical CGM and data is required for the program to work.
A valid email address, and phone number with email-to-text support is required for alerts.
A MySQL database and program usage for longer than 24 hours are required for data storage longer than 24 hours.

## Instructions
Create an .env file with your Dexcom, Database, and Email credentials like so:
[Sample Environment Variables](env_sample.md)

After you have made your .env file, place it in the same working directory as the Python file.

You will need to allow your Dexcom's data to be accessed by Pydexcom's API system. Pydexcom only works using the Dexcom Share feature.

To do this:
- Make sure you have at least one follower on Dexcom Share, this can be yourself on a different account
- If your account is newer, you may use an email in place of a username, make sure you know which type you account is
- Then, make sure you are sharing the credentials for your Dexcom account, not the follower's account
- You will need to make sure your password is not only numbers, as this will cause Pydexcom to not recognize your password

You will need to install pydexcom and MySQL for all features to work, I installed MySQL using Homebrew on my Mac.

```
pip3 install pydexcom
```
```
brew install mysql
brew services start mysql
```

Example Output:
```

## slope.py
Predict the next values of your Dexcom graph!

Make sure your Dexcom credentials are in an .env file like before.

Install pydexcom, pandas, numpy, and skikit-learn for this script to work

```
pip3 install pydexcom scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

Example Output:
```
Current Glucose Value at 03:41PM (CDT): 157.00
Current time: 03:41PM (CDT) - Trend: 158.30

Predicting future glucose levels...
03:46PM (CDT) - Trend: 160.20
03:51PM (CDT) - Trend: 162.10
03:56PM (CDT) - Trend: 164.00
```

This information is based solely on data, and does not incorporate factors like insulin/carb correction. It's a good predictor of what would happen to you if you didn't do anything based on your current trends. The program takes the 20 previous points and predicts the next readings based on linear regression.
